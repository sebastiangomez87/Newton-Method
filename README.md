# Newton-Method
Created by: Sebastian Gomez-Cardona
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with the function myNewton which calculates the roots of a function.
Note that the arguments for the function are myNewton(f,f_prime; iv, tolerance=1E-7, maxiter=1000) where f is a function, f' its derivative and iv the initial value
My name is Francisco Eslava (this answers to issue #1)
